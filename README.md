This analysis code takes Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones (HAR) data and produces a tidy data set of measurements per subject (30 subjects in all) per activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

The raw data set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here is the algorithm the script follows to get from raw data to tidy data.
.The training and test data sets of measurements are read in
.The training and test activity classes are read in
.The training and test subjects are read in
.Each row - in the training and test data sets - is tagged with the activity class that produced the measurements
.Each row - in the training and test data sets - is tagged with the subject from whom the measurements came
.The annotated training and test data sets are merged; we'll call this the master (measurement) data set
.Read in features and activity labels reference files
.Extract the column numbers and column names of interest - variables related to mean and standard deviation - from the features file; these column numbers and names map exacty to our master measurement data set column numbers and names
.Subset the master data set using the column numbers calculated at the previous step; we'll call this the m-std data set
.Rename the columns in the m-std data set with descriptive measurement names obtained from the features file
.Tag each row with the activity label, drop the activity class
.From m-std, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
.Write the tidy data set out to a text file
